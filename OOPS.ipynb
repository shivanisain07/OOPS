        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming style that organizes software around objects, which are collections of data and functions. OOP is based on the idea of abstract data types, a mathematical discipline that stores data and the procedures needed to process it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a template for creating objects. A class defines the shared properties and behaviors of objects that are created from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " -n Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a data entity with unique characteristics and behaviors. Objects are the fundamental units of OOP and are used to represent real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction is a design-level process that focuses on what an object does, while encapsulation is an implementation-level process that focuses on how an object's data is accessed and manipulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        " -Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that allow you to customize the behavior of your objects. They are recognized by the double underscore format, such as __methodname__().\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        " -Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that allows programmers to create new classes based on existing classes. This process enables programmers to reuse code, extend functionality, and establish relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " -Polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the ability of an entity to have more than one form, or to be used in different ways. It allows a single interface to be used for different data types, and for objects to respond differently to the same message.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using access modifiers to control access to a class's variables and methods. These access modifiers include public, private, and protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?   \n",
        " -A constructor in Python is a special method that initializes an object when a class is instantiated. It's a vital part of object-oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " -  A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.    \n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " -n Python, \"method overloading\" refers to the concept of defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within a class, allowing a single method to behave differently depending on the number or types of arguments passed to it>\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " -Method overriding in object-oriented programming (OOP) is when a subclass redefines a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows developers to customize the behavior of methods without changing the parent class's code.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - A property decorator is a built-in decorator in Python which is helpful in defining the properties effortlessly without manually calling the inbuilt function property().  \n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " -Polymorphism is an important feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) because it allows programmers to write more efficient and flexible code. It also makes code easier to maintain and update over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " -  An abstract class in Python is a class that can't be instantiated directly, but instead serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes are used to define methods and properties that subclasses must implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " -One of the top advantages of OOP is that it allows developers to divide a complex software system into small, manageable objects. Each object is responsible for a specific function. They can develop, test, and maintain these self-contained units independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - In object-oriented programming, a class variable is shared among all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each instance of a class.   \n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " -Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a class to combine behaviors or attributes from multiple other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        " -In Python, the __str__() and __repr__() methods are used to define how an object is represented as a string. __str__() is used to create a readable representation for users, while __repr__() is used to create a more detailed representation for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " -  In Python, super() is a built-in function that allows access to methods and properties of a parent or superclass from a child or subclass. This is useful when working with inheritance in object-oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " -n Python, the __del__ method, also known as a destructor, is a special method that is called automatically when an object is about to be deleted from memory, allowing you to perform any necessary cleanup tasks like releasing external resources held by the object before it is completely removed by the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " -In Python, the main difference between @classmethod and @staticmethod is that @classmethod binds the class to the method, while @staticmethod does not.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " -In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows a child class to have the same method name as a parent class, but with a different implementation. This is called method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " -Method chaining is a technique in Python that allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code. It's a common syntax in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " -The __call__ method in Python allows programmers to create classes that behave like functions. This allows instances of a class to be called like regular Python functions.   \n"
